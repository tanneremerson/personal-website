# Personal Website

## Goal

**Have Fun**

The goal of this repository is to showcase my personal website and build a
framework for keeping track of the progress I am making in life. As I learn
to build new things with new experiences and learnings, this project will
continue to grow. My current goals are to support the following features:

- [ ] Create a static frontend with Next.js displaying (tbd)
- [ ] Create a server to support dynamic call outs (contact me, etc.)
- [ ] Create a cron scheduler that can fetch data from various datasources and
  update the static frontend. Example of datasources are things like Strava to
  track running, github to track software work, and list of playlist from
  YouTube of videos I found insightful or interesting.

## Metrics of success

- All things must be built using templates.
- All things must be deployed upon build completion.
- All things must be automated.

## Technologies

- Node.js
- Next.js
